          <h5>
            Deleting of Information
          </h5>

          <p>
            You may ask us to delete some or all of the information you shared
            with us, provided, however, that we are not required to maintain
            that information as part of any commercial transaction or contract
            entered into between us. For example, we may need to maintain
            records of credit card transactions or products or services
            purchased by you from us for a period of time in the event any
            dispute or other occasion arises whereby that information may be
            required by third-parties or government entities.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may request that we delete information provided by you to us by
            emailing support@uxtheclass.com
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that we have inaccurate or incomplete information
            about you, you may request an update to your information by emailing
            support@uxtheclass.com
          </p>
          <p>
            You may request that we limit the use of your information to only
            that information required for us to conduct any transactions in
            which you engage with us. For example, you may request that we
            discontinue sending e-mails or newsletters to you about upcoming
            courses or other information regarding our products and services.
            You may opt-out from these communications by emailing
            support@uxtheclass.com as well as following the instructions on the
            communications themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless you request that we delete information provided by you, we
            will maintain that information for a reasonable period of time in
            the event that you choose, in the future, to purchase our products
            or services. For example, you may complete one of our courses, and
            not find an additional course to be of interest to you at present;
            however, we may introduce a course in the future in which you may
            wish to enroll. By maintaining your information, we make the
            enrollment process easier, as well as allowing us to provide a
            history to you of courses in which you previously enrolled.
          </p>
          <p>
            To maintain the integrity of our Website and the information you
            provide to us, we may copy that information to a secondary
            information storage device (AKA back-up). In the event that you
            request that we delete your information, we will also delete it from
            our back-up data storage to the extent that it is commercially
            reasonable to do so. Nevertheless, we do not access our back-up
            storage except under circumstances where data from our primary
            storage has been compromised (such as may occur during power surges
            or other situations where our primary storage may be damaged).
